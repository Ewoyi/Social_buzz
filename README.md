## About
As a response to the exponential growth and digital transformation of content products, the volume of data generated and collected has reached unprecedented levels. With a user base exceeding 500 million and a daily posting rate of over 100 content pieces, there arose a critical need to establish analytical teams tasked with structuring and managing this data to extract valuable insights for marketing and product development.

## Findings
In this particular project, I undertook data cleansing and validation tasks using Microsoft Excel, ensuring data accuracy and completeness, which were pivotal for precise analysis. The analysis revealed that among the 24,573 pieces of content posted during the June, 2020 - June, 2021 financial year, they could be grouped into 16 distinct categories, falling into the either audio, photos, GIFs, or videos content types.

I worked collaboratively with a team to devise an optimal data visualization strategy that greatly enhanced the final presentation. Subsequently, we created an interactive dashboard that empowered our client to make well-informed investment decisions.

As an analyst, my role extended to providing valuable technical recommendations, which played a critical role in guiding our client's investment choices based on the insights derived from our analysis.
